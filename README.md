# üèõÔ∏è archritique ai  
**Architectural Design Evaluation & Technical Assessment Platform**  

archritique ai is a **precision-driven architectural analysis system** designed to provide **objective, data-backed evaluations** of architectural proposals. Built for architects, engineers, and design professionals, it delivers **comprehensive, multi-dimensional assessments** that combine aesthetic judgment with spatial and structural feasibility analysis.  

By integrating **computational geometry**, **environmental context modeling**, and **design principle scoring**, archritique ai functions as a **professional-grade alternative to traditional peer review**, capable of interpreting and assessing concepts from early schematic design to detailed technical documentation.

## üìä Core Capabilities  

### **Integrated Design Scoring Framework**  
Evaluates proposals against multiple weighted criteria:  
- **Structural Feasibility** ‚Äì preliminary load distribution analysis, geometric stability indicators, and constructability evaluation.  
- **Spatial Relationship Efficiency** ‚Äì adjacency mapping, circulation flow optimization, and volumetric coherence assessment.  
- **Aesthetic and Formal Quality** ‚Äì proportion analysis, visual harmony metrics, and alignment with stated design intent.  
- **Contextual and Environmental Fit** ‚Äì site integration, orientation performance, and responsiveness to environmental constraints.  
- **Innovation and Originality** ‚Äì identification of novel design approaches relative to precedent benchmarks.  

### **Technical Document Interpretation**  
- Parses and analyzes **drawings, blueprints, and BIM exports**.  
- Identifies spatial conflicts, circulation inefficiencies, and potential code compliance risks.  
- Processes **3D models** to evaluate volumetric relationships and detect structural inconsistencies at concept stage.  

### **Evidence-Based Critique Engine**  
- Produces **structured evaluations** supported by quantitative metrics.  
- Eliminates subjective variability inherent in traditional review panels.  
- Aligns recommendations with professional standards and best practices in architectural design and engineering.  

### **Comprehensive Reporting**  
- Delivers **executive-level summaries** for stakeholder presentations.  
- Includes **principle-by-principle breakdowns** and **feasibility reports**.  
- Provides **actionable improvement recommendations** informed by data and industry standards.

## üöÄ How It Works  

1. **Input** ‚Äì Upload design documentation (narratives, drawings, BIM exports, or 3D models).  
2. **Analysis** ‚Äì archritique ai applies computational evaluation methods across structural, spatial, aesthetic, and contextual dimensions.  
3. **Output** ‚Äì Receive a detailed, professional-grade critique with:  
   - Objective scoring across multiple design principles  
   - Spatial and structural feasibility analysis  
   - Targeted recommendations for refinement
